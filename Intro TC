hi troops
new to BlueSky
in the main using Apple devices, with preferred coms tool being my ipad air with ios 18.11
only problem encountered using the ipad, is not being able to access the comments in read mode
all attempts so far lob me into reply mode, with no apparent alternative. 
I am 88 years old, Australian, retired, used to develop programs using MS Access and MS basic for the Australian Transport Industry and pallett control, long ago ie 30 to 35 years :- 1980's to 2000's, forgotten most it by now, so seeking a little assistance here. 
thanks in anticipation
